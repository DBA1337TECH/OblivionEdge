# SMTPGhost

SMTPGhost is a lightweight SMTP server and client implementation designed for testing and development purposes. It includes:

- **smtp_server.c**: A C-based SMTP server that handles email transactions and provides a simple interface for sending and receiving messages.
- **smtp_client.py**: A Python-based SMTP client for interacting with the server, enabling easy testing and email delivery.

This project is part of the `oblivon_dev/smtp_server/` directory and is ideal for developers looking to understand or experiment with SMTP protocols in a controlled environment.
